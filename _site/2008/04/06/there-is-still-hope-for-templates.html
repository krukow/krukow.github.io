<div class="post">
I am interested in JavaScript. One reason I got interested in JavaScript was a discussion about templating languages with Trifork colleagues <a href="http://braindump.dk/tech/">Joakim</a> and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/krestenkrabthorup">Kresten</a>  (or perhaps it would be more correct to say that we were discussing better ways of implementing the View-part of traditional Model-View-Controller web applications). I ended up liking the idea that the best approach was to dump templates altogether and write the whole client application in a high-level language, i.e., JavaScript, rather than using any of the existing templating languages. Hence, the interest in JavaScript. In fact, I got so interested in JavaScript that I forgot all about templating languages again. That was until recently when I remembered the original discussion, and started thinking about templating again. It was actually some good fun thinking about this -- who would have thought? Anyway, enough about me... Here is the idea.<br /><br />The language is called HOPE Templates, or just HOPE. The acronym is for Higher-Order Partially Evaluated Templates. Obviously two important ideas are (i) higher-order: templates are a type of functions and the input and output of these functions can be templates; (ii) templates are partially evaluated, meaning that general templates with multiple inputs can be specialized with respect to each input. <br /><br />That's it! These two powerful concepts are the core of the language. I'll illustrate the HOPE idea through a series of examples. <br /><br />Simple Template 1:<br /><code><br />Hello World!<br /></code><br />Any string is a (zero-order) template; when applied, the above template always outputs 'Hello World!'<br /><br />Simple Template 2:<br /><code><br />HelloTpl = &lambda;x.Hello x!<br />RuleTpl = &lambda;x.x, you rule!<br /></code><br />This defines two named templates, e.g., 'HelloTpl' takes an input 'x' and outputs "Hello x!", where 'x' is replaced with what-ever the template is applied to. Note the use of &lambda; for template abstraction -- this is to suggest the higher-order functional nature of templates (and it is concise too).<br /><br />An important concept here is that any text in the program that is not a bound variable (or any language syntax) is just zero-order templates. Conversely, if a variable is bound by a lambda, then its occurrence means to 'insert the input template here'. We allow the &alpha;-conversion from the lambda calculus so that <code>&lambda;x. Hello x!</code> is the same as <code>&lambda;y. Hello y!</code>. This means that we can insert/apply templates without having to escape characters: if there is a clash we can always just &alpha;-convert.<br /><br />So far nothing new. <br /><br />Simple Template 3:<br /><code><br />ConcatTpl = &lambda;x,y,arg. (x arg)(y arg)<br /></code><br />This template is meant to be used as a higher-order template that takes two templates  (x,y) and an argument (arg). It applies each template to the argument.<br /><br />Example 1:<br /><code><br />ConcatTpl HelloTpl RuleTpl ~ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&lambda;arg.(HelloTpl arg)(RuleTpl arg) ~ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &lambda;arg.(Hello arg!)(arg you rule!)<br /></code><br />The application of a template is left-associative so the first line is (ConcatTpl applied to HelloTpl) applied to RuleTpl. The ~ is an equivalence relation invented for this blog posting. You can think of it as meaning 'is the same template as'. I haven't defined it formally, but it must be similar to the lambda calculus conversion rules.<br /><br />I'm not sure about brackets yet. They are needed for grouping and are definitely not part of the output.<br /><br />Partial evaluation. Consider the following template:<br /><code><br />Tag = &lambda;name,clz,content.<br />&lt;name class="clz"&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;content<br />&lt;/name&gt;<br /></code><br />This is just a normal curried function so we have<br /><code><br />Tag div ~ <br />&lambda;clz,content.<br />&lt;div class="clz"&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;content<br />&lt;/div&gt;<br /></code><br />However, we can do also partial evaluation (application with respect to one or more named arguments). For example<br /><code><br />Tag clz:selected ~ <br />&lambda;name,content.<br />&lt;name class="selected"&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;content<br />&lt;/name&gt;<br /></code><br /><br />Now I think it starts to get interesting ;-) <br /><br />A final concept I would like is something like the following called operator definition. A simple definition could be:<br /><code><br />Mine = &lambda;x.I own x!<br /></code><br />An operator definition generalizes a simple definition by having variables on both sides of the equality symbol. For example:<br /><code><br />x.y = &lambda;x,y,z.&lt;x class="y"&gt;z&lt;/x&gt;<br /></code><br />This does several things. First it defines a named template '.', like<br /><code><br />. = &lambda;x,y,z.&lt;x class="y"&gt;z&lt;/x&gt;<br /></code><br />But it does more! It also allows for the following syntactic sugar: .highlight meaning<br /><code><br />.highlight ~&lambda;x,z.&lt;x class="highlight"&gt;z&lt;/x&gt;<br /></code><br />and e.g. <br /><code><br />div.highlight ~ &lambda;z.&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;z&lt;/div&gt;<br /></code><br />so <br /><code><br />div.highlight HOPE! ~ &lt;div class="highlight"&gt;HOPE!&lt;/div&gt;<br /></code><br /><br />Combined with a notion of default values, this looks similar to <a href="http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/">something we seen before and like </a> ;-), but I believe that it is much more powerful!<br /><br />Here are a few notes to myself:<br /><ul><br /><li>How do you implement it efficiently? I don't know. But on my language get-to-know-better list is Scheme, and it think this might be a good candidate language to use when implementing this. HOPEfully I will blog about that one day.</li><br /><li>Dealing with data: lists and maps. Pattern-matching on data types. How much do we need?</li><br /><li>Modules and imports... namespacing</li><br /><li>   whitespace   </li><br /><li>flexible language syntax: an idea where the language syntax can be redefined locally in case it overlaps too much with the template content...</li><br /><li>This could make templating fun again ;-), but remember to stay within templating.</li><br /></ul>
