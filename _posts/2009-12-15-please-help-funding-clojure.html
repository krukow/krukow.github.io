Rich Hickey, creator of Clojure:

<blockquote>As should be obvious, Clojure is a labor of love on my part. Started as a self-funded sabbatical project, Clojure has come to occupy me far more than full-time. However, Clojure does not have institutional or
corporate sponsorship, and was not, and is not, the by-product of
another profitable endeavor. I have borne the costs of developing
Clojure myself, but 2009 is the last year I, or my family, can bear
that. </blockquote>

I would be such a shame if development were to slow down or stop completely because of such a small amount of money... So, please donate to the project.
