[This is really old news, but I still want to express my opinion...]<br /><br />I originally started using the ExtJS framework for the following reasons: 1) It had a large set of high-quality, customizable and extensible UI components, 2) it had high-level abstractions that just made sense to me, yet at the same time it was easy to "hook in" to implementation specifics when needed, and 3) it was available under the terms and conditions of the LGPL license (meaning, in any reasonable interpretation, that it could be used (linked-to) in products with other licenses). <br /><br />Item 3 has changed: Release 2.1 of Ext changed its open source license to GPL. This is really disappointing to me as I've invested a lot of time by now learning and developing with the framework, under the assumption that it (and future releases) would be LGPL licensed. I've even recommended it to clients for the same reasons mentioned above.<br /><br />Anyway, this change raises a lot of questions since in any reasonable interpretation of GPL, the change must restrict the permissions granted to anyone using the open source Ext license. First of all there are a lot of questions that relate to what it even means for a web application to be licensed under GPL (or LGPL for that matter). I won't repeat the arguments here since is has been discussed extensively elsewhere: <br /><br /><a href="http://www.rockstarapps.com/wordpress/?p=100">Does GPL make sense for Ajax libraries?</a><br /><a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html">GPL FAQ</a><br /><a href="http://abotar.com/blog/2008/04/21/time-to-fork-ext-js-and-mygwt/">time-to-fork-ext-js-and-mygwt</a><br /><a href="http://www.linux-mag.com/id/3017">The GPL Has No (Networked) Future</a><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ext_(javascript_library)">Links</a><br /><a href="http://mjg59.livejournal.com/84586.html">Discussion - seem high-quality.</a><br /><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/openext/">So the fork: OpenExt</a> and its <a href="http://openext.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/openext/trunk/LICENSE.txt?view=markup">LGPL license</a><br /><a href="http://www.jroller.com/sjivan/entry/my_response_to_jack_slocum">Jivan's response to Jack Slocum's post on the GWT-Ext forum</a><br /><a href="http://extjs.com/blog/2008/04/27/open-source-license-exception-for-extensions/">Floss ExtJS Exceptions</a><br /><br />I still don't know how to interpret GPL legally in a web application setup, and I guess nobody really knows what it means (as far as I know there are no past examples of legal practice on this particular issue). <br /><br />To me there are two current alternatives (assuming that you insist on still using ExtJS): Use only Ext in version 2.0.2 (or OpenExt/SuperExt), or use Ext2.1+ and release you client under GPL. Regarding the second alternative, according to Jack Slocum's own interpretation of the GPL license you would have to release also serverside code as GPL if the server delivers ExtJS with the web page...
