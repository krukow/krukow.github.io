In case you haven't noticed there is a very interesting Clojure book coming out, titled "<a href="http://www.manning.com/fogus/">The Joy of Clojure</a>,"  written by two very interesting authors that anyone hanging out in the Clojure community should know: <a href="http://twitter.com/chrishouser">Chris Houser</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/fogus">Michael Fogus</a>. 

As an appetizer, the first chapter is available for free:

<a href="http://www.manning.com/fogus/Fogus_MEAP_Ch1.pdf">Clojureâ€”A Lisp for the Java Virtual Machine</a>

I've read the first chapter and the book looks very promising! To quote the last paragraph of chapter one:

<blockquote>We've talked a little about how this book will go beyond what Clojure is to why it's designed the way it is and how that design can be exploited through idioms that will help you think in Clojure. So lets stop talking about what this book will do and get on with the doing.
Fasten your seat belts.</blockquote>

I've fastened my seat belt and ordered my copy :-)
