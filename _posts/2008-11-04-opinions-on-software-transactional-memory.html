There seems to be an ongoing discussion about the value of software transactional memory. Recently IÃ¸ve seen critiques My interest in this discussion stems from my interest in the <a href="http://clojure.org">Clojure programming language</a> which has its own unique STM implementation. I have a strong belief in the value of Clojure, so naturally I am interested in whether it's STM really does deliver.
