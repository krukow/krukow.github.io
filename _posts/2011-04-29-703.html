I've managed to arrange a free <a href="http://www.clojure.dk">DCUG</a> meetup in Copenhagen in conjunction with Goto CPH. We will be several Clojure "stars": Christophe Grand and Lau Jensen, Stefan Richter and Stefan Tilkov.

Right now we have only one registration apart from the people above and myself - so come on :)

Time and date:  May 12th, Thursday 19:15 - 20:15 / Location: Room 202
Location: <a href="http://gotocon.com/cph-2011/venue/">GOTO Copenhagen 2011 takes place in Radisson Blu Falconer Hotel & Conference Center</a>
